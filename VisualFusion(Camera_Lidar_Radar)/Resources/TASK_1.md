# TASK 1: Git clone repository: 
Use this Git repository to host your projects.
https://github.com/Mayakshanesht/open_source_av.git

## Steps to follow:
Participants can access and contribute to above GitHub repository through the following steps:

1. Fork the Repository: Participants can fork the above repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the GitHub repository page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository:
After forking, participants can clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git. They can do this by running the following command in their terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ParticipantUsername/YourRepository.git
    ```

    Replace `ParticipantUsername` with the participant's GitHub username and `YourRepository` with the name of above repository.

3. Create a New Branch: Participants should create a new branch for their contributions or project. This can be done using the following Git command:

    ```
    git checkout -b project-branch
    ```

    Replace `project-branch` with an appropriate name for your branch.

4. Make Changes: Participants can make changes to the codebase, documentation, or other project files locally on their machine using their preferred code editor.

5. Commit Changes: Once participants have made their changes, they should commit them to their local branch using Git. They can do this with the following commands:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
    ```

6. Push Changes: After committing their changes locally, participants need to push their branch to their forked repository on GitHub:

    ```
    git push origin project-branch
    ```

7. Open a Pull Request (PR): On their forked repository page on GitHub, participants can open a pull request by clicking the "New pull request" button. They should select the appropriate base and compare branches, provide a descriptive title and description for their PR, and then submit it for review.

8. Participate in Code Review: As the project owner, you will receive notifications for new pull requests. Review the changes, provide feedback, and request any necessary modifications from the participant. Once satisfied, you can merge the pull request into the main repository.

9. Sync Forked Repository: Participants should regularly sync their forked repository with the upstream repository (above repository) to incorporate any changes made by other contributors. They can do this by adding the upstream repository as a remote and pulling changes from it:

By following these steps, participants can access above GitHub repository, contribute changes, and collaborate effectively on the project.
